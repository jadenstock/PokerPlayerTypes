High Aggression Frequency: Their Total AFq of 52.14 and high CBet F percentage (67.83) suggest they are aggressive in both pre-flop and post-flop play, often pressuring opponents into making mistakes.

Counter Their Aggression: With a high aggression frequency, be prepared to call down with stronger hands and trap them when they overplay their aggression.
