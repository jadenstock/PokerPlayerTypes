I have some poker stats I'd like help analyzing.
I have gathered some stats on a cluster of players.
I have then organized the players into various clusters.
I am going to give you the average stats of players within a given cluster.
I will also include how far off each stat is from the population average.
I'd like you to do three things.
1) rate the skill level of players in this cluster out of 10.
2) Give me an overview of this clusters play-style.
3) Give me detailed notes on the best way to exploit players in this cluster.
4) Give me a sea-creature that represents this cluster of players.

Definitions of the stats:

PFR/VPIP:
Definition: The ratio of Pre-Flop Raise (PFR) to Voluntarily Put Money in Pot (VPIP).
Importance: Indicates a player's aggression and willingness to enter the pot. A higher ratio suggests a more aggressive player.

VPIP (Voluntarily Put Money in Pot):
Definition: The percentage of hands a player plays voluntarily (including calls, raises, and limps).
Importance: Reflects how loose or tight a player is. A high VPIP indicates a loose player who plays many hands, while a low VPIP indicates a tighter player.

PFR (Pre-Flop Raise):
Definition: The percentage of hands a player raises pre-flop.
Importance: Shows aggression and indicates a playerâ€™s strategy. A high PFR usually means the player is aggressive and selective about their hand range.

Limp:
Definition: The percentage of hands in which a player enters the pot by calling the big blind instead of raising.
Importance: High limping can indicate a passive playstyle and can be exploited by raising more often against limpers.

CC 2Bet PF (Call Check 2Bet Pre-Flop):
Definition: The percentage of times a player calls a raise after having limped in.
Importance: Indicates how often a player is willing to see a flop after a raise, showing their comfort with various hands.

Total AFq (Aggression Frequency):
Definition: A measure of how often a player takes aggressive actions (betting or raising) compared to passive actions (checking or calling).
Importance: A higher AFq indicates a more aggressive player, which can affect how you approach them in hands.

3Bet PF (3-Bet Pre-Flop):
Definition: The percentage of times a player re-raises after an initial raise before the flop.
Importance: A high 3Bet percentage suggests a player is aggressive and willing to challenge opponents pre-flop.

4Bet PF (4-Bet Pre-Flop):
Definition: The percentage of times a player re-raises after a 3Bet.
Importance: Indicates how often a player is willing to push their advantage, often associated with strong hands or a highly aggressive style.

2Bet PF & Fold:
Definition: The percentage of times a player raises pre-flop and then folds to a re-raise.
Importance: A high percentage indicates that the player may be aggressive but not committed to their hand, making them vulnerable to pressure.

Avg PF All-In Equity:
Definition: The average percentage of equity a player has when going all-in pre-flop.
Importance: Indicates how often players find themselves in favorable situations when committing their stacks, reflecting their hand selection.

CBet F (Continuation Bet Frequency):
Definition: The percentage of times a player bets after being the pre-flop aggressor.
Importance: A high CBet frequency suggests a player is willing to continue their aggression, which can indicate a strong or well-represented hand.

Fold to F CBet:
Definition: The percentage of times a player folds to a continuation bet after having checked or called.
Importance: A high percentage indicates that the player is likely to give up on hands when faced with continued aggression, which can be exploited.

XR Flop (Check-Raise Flop):
Definition: The percentage of times a player check-raises on the flop.
Importance: A higher percentage indicates a tendency to trap opponents, which can signal a strong hand and should be respected in play.

Fold to Steal:
Definition: The percentage of times a player folds to a steal attempt from the button or cut-off.
Importance: A low percentage indicates that the player is more likely to defend their blinds, which can inform your strategy when stealing.

Att To Steal (Attempt to Steal):
Definition: The percentage of times a player attempts to steal the blinds.
Importance: A high attempt-to-steal percentage indicates an aggressive strategy, which could lead to more opportunities for opponents to defend.

Call R Eff (River Call Efficiency):
Definition: How many dollars you win on average per dollar called on the river.
Importance: Anything less than 1 means you're calling too much. Anything too high indicates that you're not calling enough.

WWSF (Won When Saw Flop):
Definition: The percentage of pots a player wins after seeing the flop.
