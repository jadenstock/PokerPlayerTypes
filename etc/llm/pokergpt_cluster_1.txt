1. Skill Level: 8/10
This cluster demonstrates a strong understanding of poker fundamentals with disciplined aggression and selective hand selection. Their stats indicate a solid grasp of strategic play, making them relatively skilled players.

2. Overview of Play-Style:
Tight-Aggressive (TAG): With a VPIP of 24.84 and PFR of 16.46, this cluster plays a tighter range of hands but does so aggressively. This style is typical of strong players who are selective yet assertive.
High PFR/VPIP Ratio: A PFR/VPIP ratio of 67.08 suggests a high level of aggression relative to the hands they choose to play, indicating they prefer raising over limping.
Defensive Against Steals: With a Fold to Steal percentage of 64.66, they are likely defending their blinds effectively and not easily giving up on potential opportunities.
Moderate CBet Frequency: A CBet F of 64.24 shows they follow up their pre-flop aggression with continuation bets, often maintaining pressure on opponents.
Disciplined River Play: Their Call R Eff of 1.69 indicates they are making profitable calls on the river, likely due to strong hand reading skills.
3. Exploitation Strategies:
Apply Pressure Post-Flop: Though they are aggressive pre-flop, their Fold to F CBet percentage of 46.18 suggests they can be pressured post-flop. Consider applying aggression on the turn and river if they show weakness.
Challenge Their Steals: With a relatively low Att To Steal of 37.1, they may not be stealing as frequently. However, when they do, they might have a stronger range. Be prepared to challenge their steals with solid hands.
Exploit High Fold to 2Bet PF: Their 2Bet PF & Fold percentage of 38.04 suggests they can be pressured with 3-bets pre-flop, particularly when they open from late positions.
Target Their Limping Range: Although they limp infrequently (Limp: 2.26), when they do, it's an opportunity to raise and isolate against a potentially weaker range.
Respect 3Bet and 4Bet Aggression: Given their moderate 3Bet (9.53) and 4Bet (6.57) frequencies, be cautious when facing aggression, as they might have a stronger range.
4. Sea-Creature Representation: Dolphin
This cluster can be compared to dolphins: intelligent, strategic, and able to navigate the poker waters with skill and precision. They are not overly aggressive but can be formidable opponents when they choose to act.
