1. Skill Level: 5/10
This cluster demonstrates a moderate understanding of poker strategy, with some aggressive tendencies but also passive elements. They show potential but have exploitable weaknesses that prevent them from being more effective.

2. Overview of Play-Style:
Moderately Aggressive and Loose: With a VPIP of 35.68 and a PFR of 18.33, these players are somewhat active but not overly aggressive. Their PFR/VPIP ratio of 51.94 suggests a balanced approach between aggression and passivity.
Moderate Limping: A Limp percentage of 6.59 indicates they occasionally enter pots passively, which can be exploited by more aggressive opponents.
Average Aggression Frequency: Their Total AFq of 40.8 suggests they are not overly aggressive, often missing opportunities to apply pressure.
Decent Blind Stealing: An Att To Steal percentage of 40.23 indicates they attempt to steal blinds with some frequency, reflecting a basic understanding of aggressive strategies.
3. Exploitation Strategies:
Pressure Their Passive Plays: With a relatively low aggression frequency and average Fold to F CBet percentage (43.85), apply pressure on the flop and turn to exploit their tendency to give up on marginal hands.
Capitalize on Limping: Their occasional limping can be exploited by raising with a wider range to isolate them and capitalize on their weaker starting hands.
Challenge Their CBet: They have a moderate CBet F of 59.89, so consider floating more often and applying pressure on later streets if they show weakness.
Defend Against Blind Steals: Their Fold to Steal percentage (45.55) suggests they might be vulnerable to aggressive defense of blinds, so be prepared to re-raise or call steals with a strong range.
Be Wary of River Calls: Their Call R Eff of 1.41 indicates they make somewhat profitable river calls, so be cautious when bluffing on the river.
4. Sea-Creature Representation: Crab
This cluster can be compared to crabs: they have a balanced approach, moving sideways with caution but capable of snapping back when provoked. While not overly aggressive, they can be tricky to deal with if not approached carefully.
